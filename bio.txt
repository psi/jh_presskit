JD Harrington fell in love with electronic music and rave culture as a teenager growing up in Florida during the late 90s. He bought his first turntables soon thereafter and began DJing, though it remained a hobby for years. Upon moving to NYC in early 2007, JD quickly found himself immersed in the city's thriving techno scene. Newly inspired by the sounds and energy of life in New York, JD resolved to return to DJing in earnest. Moving into Brooklyn's Fat Camp complex last summer, he began playing frequent afterhours sessions and cultivating a brand of techno that is deep, dark and heady. JD made his public debut behind the decks at Den of Thieves in September to an excellent reception. He has since joined Juan Gaviria and Eric Cloutier as a resident at Den of Thieves and has played at The Bunker as part of the Fat Camp crew.
